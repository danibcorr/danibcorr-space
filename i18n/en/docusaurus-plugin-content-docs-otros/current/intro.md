Welcome to this section of additional content! Here you will find topics that, although not directly related to programming or artificial intelligence, are closely linked to the world of technology. I explore areas such as 3D printing and key concepts of telecommunications engineering. This last section offers a summary of the most important aspects of my training in this field, which are also reflected in my current professional experience.

I invite you to explore and enjoy this content. If you discover any errors or have suggestions, I encourage you to contribute with a pull request in the Wiki's GitHub repository. In this way, you will be helping to build and improve this space in Spanish, making knowledge more accessible and diverse for the entire community. Thank you for your interest and for contributing to the growth of this project!
