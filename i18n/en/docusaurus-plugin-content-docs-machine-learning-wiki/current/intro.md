Welcome to this section! Here you will find specialized content on the development of software systems, with a particular focus on experimentation and the advancement of artificial intelligence. I explore every stage of the development process, from the fundamentals of the most commonly used algorithms in machine learning to advanced deep learning concepts, leveraging the most prominent libraries in the industry.

I also address essential aspects such as environment creation and management, dependency maintenance, good programming practices and key tools to bring models to production. My goal is to share and organize the knowledge I have acquired in this field, highlighting the most important elements of my training and professional experience.

I invite you to dive into this content and enjoy it. If you find any errors or have suggestions, I will be happy to receive your contribution through a pull request in the Wiki's GitHub repository.
