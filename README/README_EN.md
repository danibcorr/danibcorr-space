# About me and this repository

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dani, Electronic Systems Engineer, and I welcome you to my personal wiki. This is my space where I gladly share everything I'm learning about artificial intelligence, data science and programming. My goal is to create a centralized, accessible and useful site for all those interested in expanding their knowledge in these fascinating areas.

The content is organized by categories to make navigation easy and clear. In each section you will find detailed documentation, practical examples and recommended resources.

If you are interested in connecting, feel free to do so through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danibcorr/).

I hope you enjoy exploring this site as much as I enjoy sharing what I learn. Happy learning!
